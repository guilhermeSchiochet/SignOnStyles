# 📃 About

The project is a login screen I developed using HTML and CSS. It was quite a challenge for me since I was still learning these languages. The login screen consists of a form that includes fields for username and password, a link to reset the password, a checkbox to remember the user, and a button to submit the form and log in. The layout is responsive and features a background image. I used styles to format the form elements, including input fields, labels, icons, and buttons
